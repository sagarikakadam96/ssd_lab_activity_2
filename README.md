For q1, I am identifying the number of lines in te text file using wc, then I calculate the line number of middle line of the text file.
I pass this middle linenumber to NR in awk to print that record/line number.

For q2, a single line awk command is used, I change the default separator and output only the last field/column.

For both scripts , provide the path to file.

./q1.sh /home/sagarika/ssd/Lab_Activity/Lab2/test

./q2.sh /etc/shells
